Over the centuries, many Civilizations have rose to power but just has many have fallen.
If history has taught us one thing, that thing would be, that it repeats itself.
As power grows, so does the hunger for more power, People begin to want it all.
This leads to destruction and chaos. Wars begin to break out, and as it has been said before
"War, war never changes"

So will your Civilization withstand the harsh nature of people?
Or will your community be a friendly one?

Have we finally learnt from our past mistakes?
Will this be the Civilization that withstand the sands of time?
